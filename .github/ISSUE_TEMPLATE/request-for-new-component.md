name: Request for new component
about: A suggested approach on designing and documenting new Styleguide components.

Overview
===

_This is the component greeting card. Explain objectively in a few sentences what it's about._


Purpose
===

_Which problems were you trying to solve when you came up with this? What use cases does it cover that other components don't? Don't hesitate to mention other existing similar components and why they don't work for you._

Design decisions
===

_Try to justify each and every decision you took while designing this component. Why did it end up looking and behaving this way, and not somehow else?
This section is very important for the design process, but it doesn't need be part of the final documentation._

Examples
===

_Show where you're already using it or where you envision it being used. Don't worry about cropping your screenshot, it's good if you capture the full context of your application._


Figma link
===

_Pro tip: Figma allows deeplinking, which means you can create a link that opens the project directly focusing the selected element. To do this just select the component and copy the URL, which should end up with a `node-id` (something like `/VTEX-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1`)._
