name: (A) Request for new component
about: A guide for requesting, designing and documenting new Styleguide components.

---

<!-- This is a guide to help get your mental juices flowing, and NOT a rigid and bureaucratic form to be filled out. Scrape everything and start from scratch if it doesn't work for you ;)

Try to go as far as you can don't worry if you don't fill out all sections. This is a collaborative process and others will join to help you ;)_ -->

# 1. Request

## Overview

<!-- Explain objectively in a few sentences what this component is about. This is like the component's greeting card. -->

## Purpose

<!-- 
- Which problems were you trying to solve when you came up with this?
- What use cases would it cover that other components don't?
- Are there existing Styleguide components that might be similar but that don't work for you? Why?
-->

## Examples & Context

<!--
It's screenshot time! Don't worry about cropping it, it's good if you capture the full context of your application.
-->

## Benchmark

<!--
Can you point out to existing solutions in other products that you think would work for you?
Feel free to explore some great Design Systems listed in our References doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-L3xllgWx1nF6mhOryHMw4o8d1_3-AKtC9pGO2VywBg/edit
-->


# 2. Process

## Design decisions

<!--
- Which directions you chose to take in this component's design and why?
- Why did it end up looking and behaving this way, and not somehow else?
- Are there possible variations?
- Are there non-obvious "props" (React customizable attributes) you foresee this component will need? An obvious prop would be a button text or a card title and content.
-->

## Do's and dont's

<!--
Can you already identify some non-obvious guidelines that may orient designers and developers to employ this component at its best?
-->

## Figma link

<!--
Link to the working draft of this component on Figma.

Pro tip: Figma allows deeplinking, which means you can create a link that opens the project directly focusing the selected element. To do this just select the component and copy the URL, which should end up with a `node-id` (something like `/VTEX-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1`).
