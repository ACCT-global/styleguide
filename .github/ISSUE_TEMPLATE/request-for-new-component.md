name: Request for new component
about: A suggested approach on designing and documenting new Styleguide components.

_Don't take this template as a rigid form to fill out, it's more like an inspirational guide to help get your mental juices flowing ;) Scrape everything if you want to._

_Try to fill the more sections you can, but don't worry if you can't feel them all, this is a collaborative process and other might join to help you ;)_ 

# 1. Request

_Let's try to collect as much information as possible about your needs to make sure we design the best solution._

## Overview

_Explain objectively in a few sentences what this component is about. This is the component's greeting card._

## Purpose

- _Which problems were you trying to solve when you came up with this?_
- _What use cases would it cover that other components don't?_
- _Are there existing Styleguide components that might be similar but that don't work for you?_

## Examples

_Show where you're already using it or where you envision it being used. Don't worry about cropping your screenshot, it's good if you capture the full context of your application._

## Benchmark

_Can you point out to other Design Systems' solutions that you think would work for you?_

# 2. Process

## Design decisions

_Try to justify each and every decision you took while designing this component. Why did it end up looking and behaving this way, and not somehow else?
This section is very important for the design process, but it doesn't need be part of the final documentation._

## Do's and dont's

_Can you already identify some non-obvious guidelines that may lead users to use this component at its best?_

## Figma link

_Link to the working draft of this component on Figma._

_Pro tip: Figma allows deeplinking, which means you can create a link that opens the project directly focusing the selected element. To do this just select the component and copy the URL, which should end up with a `node-id` (something like `/VTEX-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1`)._
