This section is designed to `Table V1` users that desire to upgrade and enjoy the `V2` benefits. Will be discussed the key differences between the two. The reading of the V2 documentation is essential, though.

### Schema vs Columns

The V1 introduced the concept of the table schema, which was a JSON object of type:

```ts
type Schema = {
  properties: {
    [key: string]: {
      title: string
      width: number
      minWidth: number
      cellRenderer: ({
        cellData,
        rowData,
        updateCellMeasurements,
      }) => React.ReactNode
      headerRight: boolean
      sortable: boolean
      headerRenderer: ({ columnIndex, key, title }) => React.ReactNode
    }
  }
}
```

The V2 take on the same problem is the `columns` property, which is an array of columns of type:

```ts
type Column = {
  id?: string
  title?: string | Element | Function
  width?: number | string
  cellRenderer?: (cellData: {
    data: unknown | object
    rowHeight: number
    currentDensity: Density
    motion: ReturnType<typeof useTableMotion>
  }) => React.ReactNode
  sortable?: boolean
  extended?: boolean
  condensed?: string[]
}
```

We can conclude that:

- ➕ The `title` now supports strings or objects.
- ➕ The `width` that was a number, is now a string or a number.
- ➕ We have two new props: `extended` and `condensed`, to handle what rowData was supposed to deal with.
- ♻️ The `key` was converted to an `id` prop of the column object.
- ♻️ `sortable` is kept and did not even change its purpose or type.
- The `cellRenderer` props:
- ➕ The cell can react to `rowHeight`, `currentDensity` and `motion`.
- ♻️ `cellData` is now called `data`
- 🚫 `rowData` is deprecated
- 🚫 `updateCellMeasurements` is deprecated
- 🚫 The `minWidth` is deprecated.
- 🚫 `headerRight` is deprecated
- 🚫 `headerRenderer` is deprecated since its job is done by title.
