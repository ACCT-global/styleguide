Alerts are used to inform about important changes or persistent conditions. Theyâ€™re one of the most prominent ways to communicate information to the user. Banners show at the top of the page or section they apply to.


Default

```js
<div>
  <div className="mb5">
    <Alert
      autoClose={3000}
      onClose={() => console.log("Auto closed after 3000ms!")}
    >
      Congrats! Your recovery code was printed and the app authenticator was
      sucessfully validated.
    </Alert>
  </div>
</div>
```
